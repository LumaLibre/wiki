## The Main Worlds

The main worlds **never** reset on Luma. Here, you can create towns, farms, mapart, or whatever else
you'd like! All builds are protected under our [gameplay rules](https://lumamc.net/rules).

## The Resource Worlds

Here you can collect any resources or materials! The resource worlds reset every month allowing you
to discover new places to loot and explore. Just make sure not to build any permanent builds here!

can access the map by typing `/map` in-game or clicking the following the link card below.
