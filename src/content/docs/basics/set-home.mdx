LumaMC offers players the ability '/set home [desired home name]' at any location, allowing you to teleport there at any time with the command '/[home name]'.
At the beginning you will only have one home, but more can be obtained through in-game ranks or store ranks. 

<Aside>
  For a detailed list of perks on each rank, see `/ranks` in-game. For store ranks, visit our
  [store](https://store.lumamc.net).
