Jobs are an integral part of LumaMC's economy system. They allow you to earn money by performing
specific tasks in-game.

Choose a job to kickstart your earnings! Use the `/jobs` command to select a job that aligns with
your skills and interests! To generate income through jobs, simply perform job-specific actions-
like breaking stone or ores for the **Miner** job.
