## What are Mob Balls?

Mob balls are an item that can be used to capture and release mobs anywhere on Luma.

## Obtaining Mob Balls

Mob balls can be obtained a variety of ways, including purchasing them from the `/luminshop` for 12
lumins each, crafting them with the recipe below _(requires Farmer level 35 or Etheral rank)_, and
of course, purchasing them from other players!
