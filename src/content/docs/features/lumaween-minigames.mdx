This article is intended to give more information to players about the active Lumaween 2025 minigames.

## Manor

<div class="list">
* Token Formula: (points) = tokens
</div>

The Manor minigame is based around **2** roles. Let's dive into them:


### The Hunter

In Manor, there's only every one 'hunter'. The hunter's job is to catch as many players before the time runs out.
For every player caught, the hunter gets **3** points. 


The hunter can see the silhouettes of any player that is `15 blocks+` from the hunter. This allows the hunter to find their next victim more easily!
In addition to that, the hunter can also see the silhouettes of any player that is `6 blocks-` from the hunter.
This gives the hunter a blind spot of about `9 blocks` that runners may use to keep their distance.


The hunter only needs one hit on a player to instantly eliminate them.


### The Runners

Any player who isn't selected to become the hunter will instead become a 'runner'. The goal is simple, don't get caught.

Runners earn points based on how long they survive. For every 40s a runner is alive, they'll earn 1 point. Once the timer runs out,
any remaining runners will be awarded 3 extra points.

Runners cannot see the hunter **unless** the hunter is within `7 blocks-` of the runner.

*direct line of sight - There are no blocks between the runner and hunter.


Runners will always be able to hear the hunter unless the hunter is `30 blocks+` away from the runner. The runner will hear a heartbeat sound
that gets faster the closer the hunter is.


If a runner is caught, they will become a spectator for the rest of the game.


## Towers

<div class="list">
* Token Formula: min((points) + 1, 15) = tokens
</div>

In Towers, players will spawn on pillars made of bedrock in a void arena and recieve a random item or block every **9 seconds**.


The objective in Towers is simple. Get as many kills as possible without falling into the void.


Points are granted based on how many other players died before you died. If 12 others died before you did,
you'll be granted 12 points.


## Paintball 2.1

<div class="list">
* Token Formula (piece-wise):

`Let p = position of player on team`
`Let w = 1 if winning team, 0 if not`
`(p <= 2 ? 6 : (p <= 5 ? 5 : 3)) + w = tokens`
</div>

In Paintball 2.1, players will be split into two equal teams with different colors.

The objective is to cover as much area on the map with your team's color as possible before the time runs out.

Points are granted based on how many blocks are covered in your team's color. The team with the most blocks covered
when the timer runs out wins the game! For every block covered in your team's color, the team earns 1 point.

Players may kill each other by throwing paintballs at each other. Kills do not grant points, but they do cover
a significant amount of area in the team's color.
